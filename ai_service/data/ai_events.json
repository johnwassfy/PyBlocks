To count how many are positive, you'd pick up each card, check if it's positive, and keep a tally. That's exactly what a loop does with a list! \n\n**Here's what you need to do:**\n1. Use a `for` loop to go through each number in your list\n2. Check if each number is positive (bigger than 0)\n3. If it is positive, add 1 to your `count` variable (which you've already started on line 3!)\n\n**Try this:** Can you write a `for` loop that goes through the `numbers` list? Start by writing something like:\n```\nfor [something] in numbers:\n```\n\nWhat do you think `[something]` should be?
