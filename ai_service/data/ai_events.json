Shows you understand their SPECIFIC problem (mention the concept/error/code pattern)\n2. Offers concrete help (not generic encouragement)\n3. Uses a relevant emoji\n4. Makes them want to click for help\n\n**GOOD EXAMPLES:**\n✅ \"I see you keep getting 'NameError' with that variable! Want help making sure it's defined first? 🔧\"\n✅ \"Your loop looks close but line 3 needs a small fix! Should I show you what's missing? 🔄\"\n✅ \"You've been staring at this for a while! Want me to break it into smaller steps? 🧩\"\n✅ \"That 'range' spelling is tricky - want to see what's wrong? 🎯\"\n\n**BAD EXAMPLES (too vague):**\n❌ \"Need some help?\" (doesn't show understanding)\n❌ \"Looks like you're stuck!\" (obvious, not helpful)\n❌ \"Want a hint?\" (too generic)\n\nGenerate the message now (ONLY the message, no explanation):\n", "ai_response": "Looking at your code, I see you're printing name and age on separate lines. 🎯 That's a great start! \n\nTo help you learn conditionals and comparisons, what if you tried adding an if-statement next?
